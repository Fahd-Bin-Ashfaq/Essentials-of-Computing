## 🎨 Styles and Templates

- **Styles**: These are ready-made text formats (like headings, subheadings, and body text).
  - Instead of changing font and size every time, just apply a style like "Heading 1" or "Title".
  - Makes your document look consistent and clean.
- **Templates**: Pre-designed documents that you can fill in.
  - Examples: Resume templates, report templates, letters, etc.
  - Saves time and gives your document a professional look.

## 📑 Table of Contents, References, and Citations

- **Table of Contents**:
  - A list at the beginning that shows all the main headings and page numbers.
  - Helps readers find information quickly.
  - Can be created automatically if you use styles properly.

- **References**:
  - Used to refer to other parts of your document, like a chart, image, or section.
  - Makes your document easier to navigate.

- **Citations**:
  - Used in academic writing to give credit to other people’s work (books, articles, websites).
  - You can insert sources and Word will format them for you (APA, MLA, etc.).

## 🤝 Collaboration Features in Google Docs

- **Real-time editing**:
  - Many people can work on the same document at the same time.
  - You can see who is editing and what changes they make.

  - You can leave notes or suggestions without changing the text.
  - Others can reply to your comments.

- **Sharing**:
  - Easily share your document with others using a link.
  - Control who can view, comment, or edit.

## 📄 Page Layout, Section Breaks, Watermarking

- **Page Layout**:
  - Set margins, page size (A4, letter), and orientation (portrait or landscape).
  - Helps control how the document looks when printed.

- **Section Breaks**:
  - Divide your document into different parts (sections).
  - Useful when you want to change the layout or headers/footers for different pages.

- **Watermarking**:
  - Light text or image that appears behind your content.
  - Used for branding or to show it's a draft or confidential (like “DRAFT” or a company logo).
