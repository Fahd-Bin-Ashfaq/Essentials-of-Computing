# 🧠 Week 3: Microsoft Word & Google Docs – Advanced

This week, you will learn advanced tools in Word and Google Docs to create professional and well-structured documents.

---

## 🎨 Styles and Templates

- **Styles**: These are ready-made text formats (like headings, subheadings, and body text).
  - Instead of changing font and size every time, just apply a style like "Heading 1" or "Title".
  - Makes your document look consistent and clean.
- **Templates**: Pre-designed documents that you can fill in.
  - Examples: Resume templates, report templates, letters, etc.
  - Saves time and gives your document a professional look.

---

## 📑 Table of Contents, References, and Citations

- **Table of Contents**:
  - A list at the beginning that shows all the main headings and page numbers.
  - Helps readers find information quickly.
  - Can be created automatically if you use styles properly.

- **References**:
  - Used to refer to other parts of your document, like a chart, image, or section.
  - Makes your document easier to navigate.

- **Citations**:
  - Used in academic writing to give credit to other people’s work (books, articles, websites).
  - You can insert sources and Word will format them for you (APA, MLA, etc.).

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Features in Google Docs

- **Real-time editing**:
  - Many people can work on the same document at the same time.
  - You can see who is editing and what changes they make.

- **Comments and Suggestions**:
  - You can leave notes or suggestions without changing the text.
  - Others can reply to your comments.

- **Sharing**:
  - Easily share your document with others using a link.
  - Control who can view, comment, or edit.

---

## 📄 Page Layout, Section Breaks, Watermarking

- **Page Layout**:
  - Set margins, page size (A4, letter), and orientation (portrait or landscape).
  - Helps control how the document looks when printed.

- **Section Breaks**:
  - Divide your document into different parts (sections).
  - Useful when you want to change the layout or headers/footers for different pages.

- **Watermarking**:
  - Light text or image that appears behind your content.
  - Used for branding or to show it's a draft or confidential (like “DRAFT” or a company logo).

---

## ✍️ Hands-on Activity: Format a Multi-Page Report Document

- Practice using:
  - Styles for headings and body text.
  - Inserting a table of contents.
  - Adding citations or references.
  - Adjusting layout and adding watermarks.
- This will help you create a professional report, just like in school or the office.

# Basics for Cyber Security Students  

This guide covers some **fundamental concepts** in simple English with examples.  

---

## 🌐 DNS (Domain Name System)  
DNS is like the **phonebook of the internet**.  
It translates **domain names** (like `google.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `142.250.190.14`) so computers can connect.  

### Example:  


Result: `142.250.190.14`  

✅ Without DNS, we would need to remember long IP addresses for every website.  

---

## 📌 Why DNS is Important  
- Easy to remember names instead of numbers.  
- Faster browsing (caching is used).  
- Essential for **security** (DNS filtering, blocking malicious domains).  

---

## 🌍 Domain  
A **Domain** is the human-readable name of a website.  

### Example:  
- Domain: `facebook.com`  
- Subdomain: `login.facebook.com`  

Domains are registered through companies called **Registrars**.  

---

## 🖥️ Hosting  
Hosting means storing your **website files** on a **server** so people can access them via the internet.  

### Types of Hosting:  
- **Shared Hosting** → many websites on one server.  
- **VPS Hosting** → Virtual private space.  
- **Cloud Hosting** → Scalable and reliable.  

---

## 🔧 Tools  
Some important tools to explore networks & domains:  
- `whois` → find domain ownership info.  
- `nslookup` → find DNS records and IPs.  
- `ping` → check if server is reachable.  
- `tracert` or `traceroute` → see the path data takes.  

---

## 🖥️ Server  
A **server** is a powerful computer that provides services to other computers (clients).  

### Example:  
- Web server → serves websites.  
- Mail server → handles emails.  
- Database server → stores structured data.  

---

## 🗄️ Database  
A **database** stores and manages information in an organized way.  

### Example:  
- Website users' info stored in **MySQL / PostgreSQL**.  
- Cybersecurity logs stored in **Elasticsearch**.  

---

## 🔐 Why These Topics Matter in Cyber Security  
- Attackers often exploit **DNS**, **servers**, and **databases**.  
- Understanding **hosting and domains** helps in penetration testing.  
- Tools like `whois`, `nslookup`, and `ping` are must-know for investigations.  

---
Google’s public DNS server will reply.  

---

## 🌍 URL (Uniform Resource Locator)  
A **URL** is the complete address of a resource on the web.  

### Example:  
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123`  
- Protocol → `https`  
- Domain → `youtube.com`  
- Path → `/watch`  
- Query → `?v=abc123`  

---

## 🔗 Protocols  
Protocols are rules that define how data is sent and received.  

- **HTTP / HTTPS** → used for websites.  
- **FTP** → used for file transfer.  
- **SMTP / IMAP** → used for emails.  
- **DNS** → translates names to IP.  

---

## 📡 Router  
A **router** connects different networks together and directs internet traffic.  

### Example:  
Your home router connects your devices to the ISP’s network.  

---

## 🔐 Firewall  
A **firewall** is a security system that blocks or allows traffic based on rules.  

### Example:  
- Block port `23` (Telnet) for security.  
- Allow only port `443` (HTTPS).  

---

## 🌍 VPN (Virtual Private Network)  
A **VPN** encrypts your internet traffic and hides your real IP address.  

### Example:  
- Without VPN → your ISP can see websites you visit.  
- With VPN → your traffic is hidden inside a secure tunnel.  

---

## 🔍 Ports  
Ports are like **doors** on a computer where data comes in and goes out.  

- Port **80** → HTTP  
- Port **443** → HTTPS  
- Port **21** → FTP  
- Port **25** → Email (SMTP)  

---

## 📊 Packet  
A **packet** is a small piece of data sent over the network.  
Every packet has:  
- Source IP  
- Destination IP  
- Data  

---

## 🧰 Additional Useful Tools for Cybersecurity  
- `netstat` → check open ports on your system.  
- `curl` → test HTTP requests.  
- `dig` → advanced DNS lookup.  
- `nmap` → scan networks for open ports.
